Implement an application for sending messages. Application should support different type of messages. Currently the supported types include SMS and E-mail. Application should offer simple UI with the following requirements:
-          Input for message recipient as a string (either mobile number or e-mail address)

-          Input for message text

-          Selection for message type

-          send button

-          list of messages that have been already sent, list should contain message type, recipient and content

-          After pressing send button the message is shown in the list of messages

 
Application should be implemented in Client – Server architecture with using Java EE
EJB should be used for remote invocations. Methods for message sending and obtaining list of sent messages should offered.
 
Additional requirements:
-          Extendable design, more message types are coming soon

-          Sent messages are persisted on server side and available when application is opened again (file can be used to store messages)

-          Preferred UI choice: Vaadin, if not possible then Swing.

-     No need to implement actual sending, it is enough to write in to logs/system out that sms or email was sent along with recipient and message content (in addition to storing it in some db/file)
-          JUnit tests if possible

-          For Server part please use JBoss 7
